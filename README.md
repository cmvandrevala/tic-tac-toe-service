# Tic-Tac-Toe Service

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cmvandrevala/tic-tac-toe-service.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cmvandrevala/tic-tac-toe-service)

## Background

This is a toy application that I will use to learn about SOA during my apprenticeship at 8th Light. The Rails app will serve different types of data to various clients in a JSON format.

## Testing

This project uses rspec as its test suite. You can run the test suite using the command:

```
bundle exec rspec spec
```
